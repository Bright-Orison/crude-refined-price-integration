# 📈 Daily Price Integration Between Crude Oil and Refined Products (2014–2023)

## 🌍 Comparative Study: US, Nigeria, and North Sea Markets

This MSc capstone project investigates the daily price integration between crude oil benchmarks—West Texas Intermediate (US), Brent Crude (North Sea), and Bonny Light (Nigeria)—and refined petroleum products (gasoline and diesel). Using a unified ARIMA and cointegration framework, the study compares market-specific efficiencies, structural breaks, and lead-lag dynamics across three structurally distinct markets.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Measure and compare short-run and long-run price relationships across US, UK, and Nigerian markets.
- Apply ARIMA and cointegration models to uncover market-specific integration patterns.
- Analyze structural breaks due to global shocks (e.g., COVID-19, Russia-Ukraine war).
- Evaluate implications for trading, risk management, and policy design.

## ❓ Research Questions
1. What relationships exist between crude oil and refined product prices across the three markets?
2. How do ARIMA and cointegration models reveal short-run and long-run dynamics?
3. What factors influence price transmission and market efficiency?

## 🔬 Methodology
- **ARIMA modeling** for short-term volatility and forecasting
- **Johansen & Gregory-Hansen cointegration tests** for long-run equilibrium
- **VECM** for error correction and lead-lag analysis
- **Structural break analysis** to assess crisis response patterns
- **Efficiency scoring** using half-life and cointegration ratios

## 📊 Key Findings
- European markets show highest integration and efficiency (score: 0.907)
- Nigerian market exhibits fastest error correction despite data limitations
- US market shows partial integration, especially weak in diesel segment
- Diesel markets are less predictable and more fragmented than gasoline

## 🧠 Tools & Technologies
- Python: `statsmodels`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Data sources: EIA, Central Bank of Nigeria
